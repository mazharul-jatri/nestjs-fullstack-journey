- Explore async/await and promise-based programming
- Introduction to TypeScript

### Phase 2: Node.js and RESTful APIs
- Build a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express
- Understand the Node.js runtime and event loop

### Phase 3: NestJS Fundamentals
- Build a NestJS backend with controllers, services, and modules
- Implement TypeORM for database management
- JWT-based authentication

### Phase 4: Advanced NestJS
- Explore microservices architecture and GraphQL with NestJS
- Implement WebSockets for real-time features

### Phase 5: Frontend Integration with Vue.js
- Full-stack app with NestJS (backend) and Vue.js (frontend)
- Handle authentication and state management

### Phase 6: Deployment and Scaling
- Deploy the full-stack app using Docker and AWS
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
